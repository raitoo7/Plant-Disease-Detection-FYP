# Plant Disease Detection and Classification System

## Overview
This project provides a web application to detect plant leaf diseases using a deep learning model.

## Important Note: Model File Missing
The trained model file `resmodel.h5` is **not included** in this repository due to size limitations.

### What You Need to Do
- Download or generate the `resmodel.h5` file separately.
- Place the `resmodel.h5` file in the root project directory (where `app.py` is located).
- Without this file, the app **cannot perform disease predictions**.



## Running the App

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/plant-disease-detection.git
   cd plant-disease-detection
2. Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Add the resmodel.h5 file to the project root.

4. Run the app:
python app.py

5. Open your browser at http://localhost:5000
